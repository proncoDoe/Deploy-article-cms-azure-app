### Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.

*For **both** a VM or App Service solution for the CMS app:*
- *Analyze costs, scalability, availability, and workflow*
- *Choose the appropriate solution (VM or App Service) for deploying the app*
- *Justify your choice*

APP SERVICE:
The costs, and scalability for a CMS app deployed through an App Service are reasonable. This is a lightweight app,
so it does not need a significant compute power. To keep running

VM:
The costs, scalability, and availability for a CMS app deployed through a VM are also reasonable. The VM allows for more large scale app's
capability.
the VM is for more customize application.

take over:
Is to go for web app because the cms app is more
of lightweight application

### Assess app changes that would change your decision.

*Detail how the app and any other needs would have to change for you to change your decision in the last section.* 

APP Service:

When the cms app keep on updating new features it will require more compute power in the feature, like functionality and customizations

VM:

When the cms app become more popular it will require
maintaince from developers and more hardware and compute power
then it become more expensive
